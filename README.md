# AI Analyst Genome

> This repo was last pushed to on February 19. Since then, the system has grown significantly through testing on more complex, real-world datasets. Everything below works, but the version we're running locally is substantially ahead of what's here. Major update coming in the next couple of days.

**A self-building AI Data Analyst.** Drop this into an empty repo with Claude Code, answer 7 questions, and it builds itself — agents, skills, helpers, templates, and a full analysis pipeline.

## What This Is

The AI Analyst Genome is a single document that bootstraps a complete AI Data Analyst product through a 3-layer inception model:

1. **You answer 7 setup questions** — where's your data, what do you want to analyze, who's the audience
2. **4 architect agents debate** and produce a build plan
3. **7 builder agents execute** the plan, creating 19 analysis agents, ~30 skills, and 6 Python helper modules
4. **You have a working AI Data Analyst** that can take a business question from framing through validated analysis to a finished slide deck

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) running on Amazon SageMaker via Amazon Bedrock (or any Claude Code environment)
- Recommended model: Claude Opus 4.6
- An empty repo or directory
- Access to your data platform (Snowflake, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, CSV files, or anything else)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo (or copy the two files into an empty directory)
git clone https://github.com/ai-analyst-lab/ai-analyst-genome.git
cd ai-analyst-genome

# 2. Open Claude Code
claude

# 3. That's it. Claude reads CLAUDE.md, reads the genome, and starts
#    the setup wizard automatically. Answer 7 questions and the build begins.
```

## What Gets Built

| Component | Count | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Pipeline Agents | 17 | Question framing → data exploration → analysis → validation → storytelling → slide deck |
| Standalone Agents | 2 | Experiment designer, connector inspector |
| Skills | ~30 | Data platform, analytical guardrails, pipeline/UX, presentation |
| Python Helpers | 6 | Charts, SQL dialects, data access, statistics, caching, error handling |
| Templates | 2 | Slide deck skeleton, component library |
| Themes | 2 | Light + dark presentation themes |

## What It Does NOT Include

- No sample data — you connect your own
- No hardcoded database assumptions — you tell it where your data lives
- No heavy statistics — descriptive analytics, root cause analysis, segmentation, funnels, trends, cohorts
- No ML or predictive modeling

## How Long Does It Take?

The full build runs in **3-5 Claude Code sessions** across 5 waves:

| Wave | Name | What Gets Created |
|------|------|-------------------|
| 0 | Foundation | Directories, config, data connection, brand tokens |
| 1 | Core Infrastructure | Python helpers, templates, themes |
| 2 | Pipeline Agents | All 19 agent specifications |
| 3 | Skills & UX | All ~30 skills, persona file, onboarding |
| 4 | Integration | Registry, validation, end-to-end test |

Progress is tracked in `_build/BUILD_STATUS.yaml` so you can stop and resume across sessions.

## Capability Tiers

| Tier | Agents | Skills | Best For |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Full** (default) | 19 | ~30 | Complete analysis → presentation pipeline |
| **Core** | ~12 | ~20 | Analysis + charts, no experiment design or opportunity sizing |
| **Minimal** | ~8 | ~12 | Data exploration + basic analysis, no presentation layer |

## Files in This Repo

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Bootstrapper — tells Claude Code to read the genome and start |
| `AI_ANALYST_GENOME.md` | The genome — complete blueprint for the AI Data Analyst |
| `README.md` | You're reading it (gets replaced after build completes) |

---

> **Note:** This README gets replaced with the actual product README once the build completes. The product README will document the finished AI Data Analyst — its agents, skills, workflows, and how to use it day-to-day.
